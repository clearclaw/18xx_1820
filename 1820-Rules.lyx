The designer would like to thank Francis Tresham for the design and development
 of the wonderful field of 18xx games, Daniel Barnes, Bruce Murphy and Shelby
 Noonan their bounteous supply of notions, complaints and sounding board
 in equal measures.
 In particular, Bruce Murphy prompted the cousins and what developed into
 the cost of business chart, and Shelby Noonan suggested what became the
 future trains.
 Additional thanks go to the many other play-testers.
 I have been honoured to design games for and with such wonderful people.
