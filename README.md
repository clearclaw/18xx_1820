## Overview

An 18xx game set in England.  Novel properties include:

- **Future trains:** Currently and increasingly unavailable trains are
  sold in advance in the early stock rounds.

- **Cousins:** Like a private company that can both buy and sell shares
  and which grants a special power to the companies it invests in.

- **Free track system:** Cities & towns appear anywhere on the map
  (subject to simple spacing rules).

- **Share counts:** Companies can be private, 5-share, 10-share,
  20-share or 50-share and can and do move up and down on that scale
  during the game.

- **Takeovers & liquidations:** Companies buy other companies and
  companies fail and are taken over (often) by the will-be British
  Rail.

- **Trains:** Trains never rust, they just get more and more and very
  much more expensive to own.

## Game components

While you can certainly make and cut out all the trains and trains
yourself, there are rather a lot of them.  To save effort (if not
money) those components are also available from The Game Crafter at:

  URL GOES HERE

The rest you'll have to make by hand.

Most components are available formatted for either A4 or US letter
sized paper.  A few, like the rules, track tiles, tile sheet, etc are
only available formatted for US letter but will print just fine on A4.

Ensure that you print without scaling.  Do not select "scale to fit"
or "fit to page".  Print everything with "no scale" or "100% scale".

**Note:** In many cases the provided art will produce more components
than needed (eg trains).  Discard the extras -- they aren't needed.

#### Outline versus nooutline:

Most files (eg shares trains and player cards) are formatted for
cutting with an Ellison Prestige Pro test die.  Use the "nooutline"
files for those components if you are using such a die.  For
everything else use the "outline" files which have thin lines
outlining each component as a cutting guide.

#### Map

There are four possible files for making the map.  Choose the one that
best fits your printing capacity:

- **1820-Map-A1.pdf**	- A single A1 page -- use with a large format printer.
- **1820-Map-A4.pdf**	- 8 A4 pages.
- **1820-Map-legal.pdf** - 6 US Legal sized pages.
- **1820-Map-letter.pdf** - 9 US letter sized pages.

The multi-page formats have small overlaps between the sections, which
allows them to be more easily laminated and then taped together into
an accurate non-gappy map which also folds up neatly for storage.

#### Shares

There are 30 companies in 1820.  I've seen as many as 27 in
simultaneous use in a single game.  If you ever see a game of 1820
which wanted more than 30 companies I'd love to hear about it!

Nominally all the companies are identical.  They all have a charter,
50 public shares, a private certificate, 18 station markers, a stock
marker, and a revenue marker.  In practice I don't make all the
companies full size.  Instead I make a small set of them go all the
way to 50 shares etc and then leave the rest with only the components
for being up to a 10-share company.  This greatly reduces component
count, storage pace, cost and manufacturing effort.

For a 10-share company you need:

  - Private certificate/share (black background).
  - 10 public certificates/shares (white background)
  - 12 station markers
  - 1 stock marker
  - 1 revenue marker

For a 50 share company the differences are:

  - 50 public certificates/shares (white background)
  - 18 station markers

I make the following 10 companies to support 50-shares, optimising for
visual distinctness and clarity on the board:

  - B&DJR
  - B&GR
  - CNR
  - L&BR
  - L&GR
  - LO&PR
  - LSR
  - OW&WR
  - S&DR
  - SRBWH&G

This gives enough for each player to be pre-allocated two 50-share
companies (you can also pre-allocate 4 additional companies to each
player -- I do -- but you may find players "borrowing" each other's
companies now and then as the company rush gets really going.

If you follow that pattern you'll need a total of 520 tooken bits:

  - 280 for 20 10-share public companies.
  - 200 for 10 50-share companies.
  - 40 for British Rail.

For a 10-share company you'll need to print two copies of the public
certificates file for that company (as there are 9 certificates per
page).  For a 50-share company you'll need to print 6 copies of that
file (and thus be left with 4 "extra" certificates).

#### Station Markers & Similar Tokens

Print the tokens on full page label paper, cut into strips and punch
using a 1/2" punch such as the following from Paper Shapers:

I then stick them to wood plugs from a Home Depot/Lowes/DIY/similar
store.  You can also use coloured wood discs from a game bits store,
but they tend to be a bit too large for the city circles and thus
don't fit well in crowded areas.

**Note:** There are no stickers for the British Rail tokens.  You'll
need about 40 for British Rail.  In order to differentiate them from
normal company tokens, I dyed mine a dark blue using cheap clothing
dye:

#### Loans

I do not provide component art for loans.  You'll have to use
something of your own devising.  I use blank scrabble tiles dyed a
bright red (see the URL for loans above for notes on how to easily and
cheaply colour/dye wood). Wood cubes or plastic square tiles from
educational supply stores would also work well.

You'll likely find your loan usage varying wildly across your initial
games.  Wisdom aside, 37 is the highest loan count I've ever seen in a
game.
